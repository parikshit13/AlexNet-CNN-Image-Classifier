The results from the MDS plots show that the points for the Faces category are closer and clustered than the other categories. This could be due to the diversity within each of the categories. Meaning, some categories like Animals, Objects, Scenes, and Human Activities can be more diverse and contain subcategories with different visual characteristics. For example, within the "Animals" category, there might be various types of animals with significantly different appearances such as horses and dogs, whereas the "Faces" category might have more consistent visual features.

In general, the observed convergence or closeness of class clusters in MDS plots across layers reflects the network's ability to learn hierarchical, abstract, and discriminative features, which aids in better class separation as it progresses through the network layers.
